# Architecture Decisions

---

## ADR-001: Monorepo Structure

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

WorkPulse will use a monorepo containing separate backend and mobile applications.

### Reason

- Easier project management
- Single GitHub repository
- Shared documentation
- Better portfolio presentation
- Easier future CI/CD setup

### Alternatives Considered

- Separate repositories for backend and mobile

## ADR-002: Feature-Based Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

The backend will use feature-based modules instead of separating code by controllers, services, and routes.

### Reason

Each business feature (Employees, Attendance, Payroll, etc.) remains self-contained, making the project easier to maintain and scale.

## ADR-003: Use tsx for Development

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

Use `tsx` instead of `ts-node-dev` to run the development server.

### Reason

- Better compatibility with modern TypeScript versions
- Faster startup
- Actively maintained
- Simpler configuration

### Alternatives Considered

- ts-node-dev

### Trade-offs

Requires a newer Node.js version (which our project already uses).
