# Architecture Decisions

---

## ADR-001: Monorepo Structure

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

WorkPulse will use a monorepo containing separate backend and mobile applications.

### Reason

- Easier project management
- Single GitHub repository
- Shared documentation
- Better portfolio presentation
- Easier future CI/CD setup

### Alternatives Considered

- Separate repositories for backend and mobile

---

## ADR-002: Feature-Based Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

The backend will use feature-based modules instead of separating code by controllers, services, and routes.

### Reason

Each business feature (Employees, Attendance, Payroll, etc.) remains self-contained, making the project easier to maintain and scale.

## ADR-003: Use tsx for Development

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

Use `tsx` instead of `ts-node-dev` to run the development server.

### Reason

- Better compatibility with modern TypeScript versions
- Faster startup
- Actively maintained
- Simpler configuration

### Alternatives Considered

- ts-node-dev

### Trade-offs

Requires a newer Node.js version (which our project already uses).

## ADR-004: Testing Strategy — Vitest + Supertest + Dedicated Postgres Test Database

**Status:** Accepted

### Decision

Use Vitest (not Jest) with Supertest for HTTP integration testing, against a dedicated `workpulse_test` PostgreSQL database — not Docker/Testcontainers, not a mocked Prisma client.

### Reason

- Vitest's esbuild-based transform matches the project's existing `tsx`/esbuild toolchain and tolerates bleeding-edge TypeScript 7 far better than Jest's `ts-jest` transform.
- Real integration tests against a real database catch more than mocked-Prisma unit tests would, especially for behavior the composite tenant-integrity foreign keys are responsible for — those constraints only mean anything when tested against real Postgres.
- Local Postgres already runs and already hosts `workpulse`; standing up a second local database (`workpulse_test`) is simpler than introducing Docker/Testcontainers, and nothing about this project's test needs requires container isolation yet.

### Alternatives Considered

- Jest — rejected due to `ts-jest` friction with TypeScript 7 and heavier config for marginal benefit over Vitest here.
- Mocking Prisma entirely — rejected; would hide exactly the kind of bug (a broken composite FK, a bad cascade rule) this schema's tenant-isolation design most needs to catch.
- Docker/Testcontainers — deferred; no concrete reason local Postgres can't provide a clean, fast test database at this project's current size.

### Trade-offs

Test files run serially (`fileParallelism: false`) rather than in parallel workers, since they share one physical test database. Negligible cost at the current suite size; would need revisiting (per-test transactions, or containerized per-worker databases) if the suite grows much larger.
